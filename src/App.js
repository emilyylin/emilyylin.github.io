        I’m a third year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
        Previously, I’ve worked as a software engineer at RBC and TD innovation labs. I’m passionate about mobile and web dev, and I’m hoping to gain some experience in the AR/VR space.

        I spend a lot of my free time working as co-pres of the UW Acabellas and as a backend developer for Develop for Good. 
        My other hobbies include badminton, violin, hula hooping, shopping, binging tv shows, and playing the mouth trumpet.
